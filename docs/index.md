# :house: Home

Welcome to the documentation hub for my homelab setup. This is a personal knowledge base where I document everything from Ansible automation to Git config, software setup, and future plans.

> ⚠️ Most of this is self-documented and a WIP. Expect notes, experiments, and a mix of trial-and-error!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Overview
- **Main Platform**: TrueNAS + Proxmox VE
- **Automation**: Ansible

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This repo is actively being updated as I continue to refine my homelab setup. Feel free to explore and borrow ideas — but expect some rough edges and personal tweaks.

## 🙋‍♂️ Notes for Myself

Some of these guides are personal reminders and shortcuts for my own reference. If you find something useful, that’s awesome — just know this wasn’t originally built to be a public tutorial.
