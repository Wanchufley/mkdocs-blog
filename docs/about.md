# 👋 About Me

> *“A little corner of the internet where I document my tinkering, learning, and tech experiments.”*

🧠 **Who I am**  
Just a random guy from Tenerife, currently based in Amsterdam, who likes tech and tinkering as much as the next guy.

💡 **Why I built this blog**  
I built this site primarily for myself, in an effort to keep as much documentation as I can of everything that I do to my personal computers and my homelab. I am not a super expert, but the willingness to get things done has got me far enough, so please feel invited to spot any mistakes I make or to give me any advise.

🔧 **Tech I enjoy**  

- 🐧 Linux (obviously!)
- ⚙️ Ansible
- 📦 Docker
- 🧪 Proxmox
- 🧠 Learning by breaking stuff
- :gun:   Counter Strike
